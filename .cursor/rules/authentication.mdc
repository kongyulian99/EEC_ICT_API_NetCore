# Authentication System

The authentication system in this project supports multiple authentication methods:

## JWT Authentication
- Uses symmetric key encryption with HMAC SHA256
- Token lifetime and refresh token settings are configured in AppSetting
- Tokens contain claims for UserName, UserId, IsAdmin, and ForceLogoutKey

## Google OAuth Authentication
- Supports login with Google OAuth
- Parses JWT tokens from Google to extract user information
- Creates new users automatically when a new Google account logs in
- See [ApiService/Controllers/AuthController.cs](mdc:ApiService/Controllers/AuthController.cs) for implementation

## Token Refresh
- Refresh tokens have longer expiration than access tokens
- The system verifies token validity before issuing new tokens
- User information is cached for faster access
