# Code Conventions

This project follows specific coding conventions to maintain consistency.

## Naming Conventions
- Controllers use PascalCase with "Controller" suffix
- Entity classes use PascalCase with "Info" suffix (e.g., `UserInfo`, `ExamInfo`)
- Interface names start with "I" prefix
- Database fields use underscore_case
- Properties in C# classes use PascalCase

## API Response Format
- All API responses follow the `ReturnBaseInfo<T>` structure
- Status information is contained in `ReturnStatus` with Code and Message
- Actual data is contained in `ReturnData`
- Success responses use Code = 1, failures use Code <= 0

## Error Handling
- Exceptions are caught and logged
- User-friendly error messages are returned in the response
- Detailed errors are logged but not exposed to clients

## Documentation
- Public methods include XML documentation comments
- Complex logic includes inline comments
- Controllers and models have class-level documentation
